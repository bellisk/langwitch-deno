I'm here to assassinate Duolingo. Keep reading if you want to find out why.

Computers evolved, language learning didn't.

It's still the same as it was a hundred years ago: 

* Dry textbooks that start off by having you parrot "Hello!" and "How are you?" while you still can't hold a basic conversation
* Duolingo courses that first teach you the names of pieces of furniture and fruit
* University courses that give you photocopied worksheets listing verb declensions to memorise

I'm going to be honest: this infuriates me. 

This isn't the most effective way to learn a language. It's not even in the top ten. It's a recipe for:

* superficial memorisation without true understanding
* useless vocabulary without basic essentials
* rigid rules without the natural expressiveness of language

And it leads to:

* confusion
* frustration
* and boredom

You might be thinking at this point – oh, so Langwitch has some fancy trick up its sleeve? Spoiler: it doesn't. 

Exactly a year ago, I just thought of the stupidest most obvious possible way, hammered out 20 lines of Python code, and it worked. Here's what it does:

1. You start off knowing nothing.
2. It introduces a word to you.
3. It asks you to translate sentences using that word.
4. It keeps doing that until it's sure you won't forget it within the next two minutes.
5. It introduces another word.
6. It asks you to translate sentences with both of those words in them, finding exactly which ones will strengthen your memory best.
7. Rinse, repeat.

Within ten minutes, you're easily forming sentences like "I wouldn't do that if it wasn't good for me" and "So if you make it, you might be able to use it to do that". 

No furniture. No bullshit. Just the most brutally efficient, optimal route to having total mastery over any language. (Except for polysynthetic ones with vowel harmony, I still have no idea how to make Langwitch work for those.)

I did a lot of things over the last year:
* I gathered a total of 35 billion sentences across 1600 languages
* I improved the multi-concept spaced-repetition algorithm at its core
* I optimised everything to hell and back – it takes 0.7 seconds to boot with and topologically order 600,000 sentences

But the basics are still the same. One new word at a time.
