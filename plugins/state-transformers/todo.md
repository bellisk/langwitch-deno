- mark a specific word as known
- ask for hints for a particular word, possibly at a particular letter position
  what characterises this module? what's the signature?
  what characterises it is, a kind of temporary control-flow, creates its own special logic then returns us to the main loop, or that it transforms the state in some way
  matching against a particular key combination or command - the mappings and their origins should be agnostic

// interface should not be a sealed loop. that prevents us from inserting new functions.
