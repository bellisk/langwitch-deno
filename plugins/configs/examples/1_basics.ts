// Langwitch v2 had to do a lot of work each time she started up.

// She had to:
// 1) load thousands of plain-text sentences into memory
// 2) detect and strip out irrelevant punctuation
// 3) tokenise those sentences into words
// 4) generate a topologically-ordered wordlist (the hardest part)
// V8 is quite fast, but for 3-5 million sentences, you're looking at a boot latency of over fifteen minutes followed by Deno crashing spectacularly.

// Langwitch v3 does this work once.

// When you give her a file called 'tagalog', she saves the results to three files:
// - tagalog.ctxs - this has all the processed sentences
// - tagalog.wordlist - this has the wordlist
// - tagalog.dict - this has a mapping between words and their hashes

// Once she detects these files exist, she won't recompute them. This means the Venetian deck with 450k sentences boots in around 0.7 seconds.
// So if you change 'tagalog' by removing or adding sentences, you need to make sure she registers the change by deleting these other generated files.
